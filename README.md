# ðŸ§  50 Days of Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome to my 50-day journey to master Machine Learning and Data Science â€” one mini project at a time.  
Each day, I build a hands-on project using real datasets, learning key ML concepts and documenting the entire process.

âœ… Beginner to Advanced  
âœ… Built in Google Colab  
âœ… Code + Visuals + Explanations  
âœ… Publicly documented on GitHub and LinkedIn
